# Notes

- Will have a nice (web) UI. 
- Navigation for each table (not including, or de-emphasizing system tables). 
- List view of rows in a table. 
- A form for adding/reading individual row data. 
- UI for creating new tables.
- List view should only show a sub-set of the row data, especially if it's a text field (or blob).
- Should keep custom _crudly table for keeping metadata?

# Todo

- Write better gem description.
